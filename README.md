This is a type of AutoBiography

An autobiography is a non-fiction story of a person’s life, written by the subject themselves from their own point of view. Autobiographies are a subgenre of the broader category of biographies, but a standard biography is written by someone other than its subject—most commonly a historian—whereas an autobiography is written by the subject.
